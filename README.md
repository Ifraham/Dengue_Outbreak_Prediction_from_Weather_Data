# Dengue_Outbreak_Prediction_from_Weather_Data
We predict dengue outbreak using weather data. To determine the degree of dengue outbreak (namely- high, medium, and low) in a region, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the SuperTML approach. Alongside this method, we also apply the traditional classifiers. We find that the CNN using SuperTML achieves excellent performance with an accuracy of 0.74, which is significantly higher than the results achieved by the traditional classifiers.
